# MindMapVisualizer

## Introduction
This project seeks to address the limitations of the many mind-map tools that are available. It allows the user to read in data and create a mind map from a csv file, add nodes and edges to the mind map manually, choose colour variations based on relative location of the child and parent nodes as well as attributes of each node,  and apply algorithms to optimally arrange the nodes visually. The nodes and edges are each shown in a table in a separate window, and can be edited directly in the table. There is an option to delete all the nodes or edges with one click. Imported data is added onto the existing data. There is a option to draw nodes by clicking on the graph. Edges can be drawn on the graph by clicking on one node, then clicking on another node. Nodes and edges can also be added in their data tables. This project is modelled off a combination of Gephi and mindmup. Ideally, there would also be a function similarly to presenting a powerpoint presentation that allows the user to run through the various nodes. This function could be used to create videos to explain related concepts.
